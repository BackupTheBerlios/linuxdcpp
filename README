Introduction
------------
This is a broken but partially working port of DC++ to Unix-likes. I have no
idea why I called it wulfor, but I know I was bored with all projects called
[arbitrary letter]dc or something. But why wulfor of all names I don't know.
Later I have realized that DC-- probably would be the best name for it since
it's no way near feature complete compared to DC++.

Requirements:
-------------
Gtkmm 2.2
pkg-config
Currently configures for, and successfully built using g++-3.3 but it will
probably work on other gcc versions as well. Just change the makefile.

Compiling:
----------
cd linux
make
./wulfor

Notes:
------
If things start acting funny and you get a lot of errors complaining it can't
find hash_map and stuff like that, try adding #undef HAS_STLPORT to 
client/stdinc.h. It's probably just my gcc install that's broken, but for some
reason it seems to define HAS_STLPORT. Maybe the order of the #ifdefs need
to be changed so that it first looks for glibcpp first or something.

Apart from a small fix in ShareManager.cpp (line 1031, strnicmp is not ANSI) 
the client code included is plain 0.4032. Apart from the issue already
mentioned it compiled without problems. Great work, whoever did it =)
