Introduction
------------
This is a broken but partially working port of DC++ to Unix-likes. I have no
idea why I called it wulfor, but I know I was bored with all projects called
[arbitrary letter]dc or something. But why wulfor of all names I don't know.
Later I have realized that DC-- probably would be the best name for it since
it's no way near feature complete compared to DC++.

Dependencies:
-------------
Gtkmm 2.2
Currently configures for, and successfully built using g++-3.3 but it will
probably work on other gcc versions as well. Just change the makefile.

Compiling:
----------
In a dream world:

cd sigc
make
cd ../sigcx
make
cd..
cd linux
make
./wulfor

Sadly, I had to make compile my own version of libsigc and libsigcx since 
the standard versions did not support functions with enough arguments. 
This means that I can't use pkg-config anymore, since this will link with the
standard libsigc on your system. So you will have to edit the makefile
manually and change all the compiler flags. The easiest way to do this
is probably to run pkg-config --cflags/--libs gtkmm-2.0, remove everything
about libsigc++ from the output and paste what's left into the makefile.
